    // The positions of our Cities will be converted from lat/lng to 3D positions
    // on a unit sphere. This avoids the singularities at the poles and makes
    // distance measurement faster. Since we're storing our position values as floats,
    // we use kiddo::KdTree rather than kiddo:FixedKdTree. The five generic parameters
    // are explained as follows:
    // 1) A: `f32` - this specifies the type of the floating point position data that we
    //    are storing in the tree. This can be either `f32` or `f64`. `f32` provides
    //    around 7 significant figures of precision. Since our source data is around 7
    //    significant figures, and we are only interested in a single decimal place (and
    //    a max of 4 or 5 significant figures),  `f32` is sufficient for our use case.
    //    `f32` consumes half the space of `f64`, and using it can improve performance
    //    since more of the internal stem nodes in the kd-tree can fit in the CPU
    //    cache. If you need more precision than 7 significant figures, Kiddo supports `f64`.
    //    If your data covers a narrow dynamic range (e.g. all of the values are within
    //    a few orders of magnitude of each other) and performance (or memory usage)
    //    is a key concern, then youn may want to experiment with converting your
    //    positions into 16-bit fixed point and using a kiddo::FixedKdTree.
    // 2) `T`: `u16` - this specifies the type of the indices that are stored in the tree.
    //    A `u16` will suffice for up to 2^16 (approx 65k) different items. A `u32` will allow you
    //    to store 2^32 (around 4 billion) different indices. Using a `u16` may
    //    result in your tree using less memory, and again this can help with performance
    //    by allowing more stem nodes to fit in the CPU cache.
    // 3) `K`: 3 - the number of dimensions that your position data has, i.e. the `k` in kd-tree.
    //    this of course depends solely on the data that you are storing. Kd tree NN and KNN
    //    queries work best with lower numbers of dimensions.
    // 4) `B`: 32 - the "bucket size". Kiddo stores points on the leaf nodes of its tree,
    //    and this value determines how many entries are stored on each leaf. 32 is a
    //    good starting point - feel free to experiment with this if you want to eke
    //    out the most performance, but I've found 32 to be a good choice most of the time.
    // 5) `IDX`: `u16` - IDX is the type used internally to index the nodes. `u16` will permit
    //    `32768 * B` items to be stored in the tree. `u32` will allow up to `~2 billion * B` items.
    //    If you want to eke out the max possible performance, benchmark with different
    //    values of this. smaller types will allow a little bit more nodes to be able to
    //    fit in the cache, but this may not necessarily equate to any improvement; YMMV.

    // Our `CityCsvRecord`s store their position as latitude and longitude, so we

    // into 3D xyz co-ordinates. Our kd-tree uses `u16` indices so we need to cast
