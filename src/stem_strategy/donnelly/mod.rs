//! Donnelly-family stem strategies.
//!
//! The Donnelly family shares the same broad layout idea: stems are arranged in
//! fixed-height minor triangles (block-height markers live in
//! [`crate::stem_strategy::markers`]) so traversal stays cache-friendly while
//! still supporting the normal `StemStrategy` query surface.
//!
//! The variants differ by how much traversal work is specialized:
//!
//! - [`Donnelly`] is the default scalar variant. It traverses one level at a
//!   time, advances dimensions once per level, and includes the current
//!   software-prefetch behavior.
//! - [`DonnellyNoPf`] is the same scalar traversal shape without the “default”
//!   naming. It exists so the public API can distinguish the non-prefetched
//!   scalar baseline from [`Donnelly`].
//! - [`DonnellyUnrolled`] keeps the same Donnelly ordering and per-level
//!   dimension cadence, but unrolls traversal within each minor triangle.
//! - [`DonnellyUnrolledBlockDim`] uses the same unrolled structure, but changes
//!   dimensions once per block rather than once per level. It is primarily the
//!   scalar reference variant for the more specialized block-at-once traversal
//!   strategies.
//! - [`DonnellySimdDescent`] performs block-at-once SIMD child selection during
//!   descent, but still uses scalar backtracking and pruning.
//! - [`DonnellySimdFull`] takes the same block-at-once descent idea and also
//!   uses SIMD-aware backtracking and pruning.
//!
//! Internally, these variants share [`core`] for scalar Donnelly indexing/state
//! and [`simd_full`] for the reusable SIMD comparison and backtrack machinery.
