//! Floating point k-d tree, for use when the co-ordinates of the points being stored in the tree
//! are floats. [`f64`] or [`f32`] are the types that are supported for use as co-ordinates,
//! or [`f16`](https://docs.rs/half/latest/half/struct.f16.html) if the `f16` feature is enabled.
//!
//! NB if you don't need to be able to add or remove items from the tree after construction /
//! deserialization, you may get better performance from [`immutable::float::kdtree::ImmutableKdTree`](`crate::immutable::float::kdtree::ImmutableKdTree`)
